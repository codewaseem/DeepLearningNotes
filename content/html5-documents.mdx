Every `XML` and `HTML` document in an HTML UA is represented by a `Document` object.
A document refers to the whole page as single unit.

### The Document object

`DOM` defines a `Document` interface.

#### The document URL

The `document` object's `URL` is defined in DOM. It is set when the `document` object is created, but can change during the lifetime
of the `document` object for example, it changes when the user navigates to a fragment on the page and
when the `pushState()` method is called with a new `URL`.

### Document resource metadata

#### document.referrer:

Returns the URL of the Document from which the user navigated to this one, unless it was blocked or there was no such document, in which case it returns the empty string.

#### document.cookie [=value]:

Returns the HTTP cookies that apply to the Document. If there are no cookies or cookies can't be applied to this resource, the empty string will be returned. Can be set, to add a new cookie to the element's set of HTTP cookies.

#### document.lastModified:

Returns the date of the last modification to the document, as reported by the server, in the form "MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss", in the user's local time zone. If the last modification date is not known, the current time is returned instead.

#### document.readyState:

Returns "loading" while the Document is loading, "interactive" once it is finished parsing but still loading subresources, and "complete" once it has loaded.

The `readystatechange` event fires on the Document object when this value changes.

The `DOMContentLoaded` event fires after the transition to "interactive" but before the transition to "complete", at the point where all subresources apart from `async script` elements have loaded.

### DOM tree accessors

The `html` element of a document is its `document` element, if it's an html element, and null otherwise.

#### document.head

The `head` element of a document is the first `head` element that is a child of the `html` element, if there is one, or null otherwise.

#### document.title [=value]

The `title` element of a document is the first `title` element in the document (in tree order), if there is one, or null otherwise.

#### document.body [=value]

The `body` element of a document is the first of the `html` element's children that is either a `body` element or a `frameset` element, or null if there is no such element.

#### document.images

Returns an `HTMLCollection` of the `img` elements in the Document.

#### document.embeds<br/>document.plugins

Return an `HTMLCollection` of the `embed` elements in the Document.

#### document.links

Returns an `HTMLCollection` of the `a` and `area` elements in the Document that have `href` attributes.

#### document.forms

Return an `HTMLCollection` of the `form` elements in the Document.

#### document.scripts

Return an `HTMLCollection` of the `script` elements in the Document.

#### collection = document.getElementsByName(name)

Returns a `NodeList` of elements in the Document that have a `name` attribute with the value `name`.

#### document.currentScript

Returns the `script` element, or the SVG `script` element, that is currently executing, as long as the element represents a classic script.
Returns `null` if the Document is not currently executing a script.

> Note: It cannot return a `module script` or `shadow script` that is currently executing.

The `document`'s text directionality is determined by the `dir` attribute.
