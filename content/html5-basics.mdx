### Structure of HTML5

A basic HTML document looks like this

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Sample page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Sample page</h1>
    <p>This is a <a href="demo.html">simple</a> sample.</p>
    <!-- this is a comment -->
  </body>
</html>
```

HTML documents consist of a tree of **elements** and **text**.

### Elements

Each element is denoted in the source by a start tag, such as `<body>`, and an end tag, such as `</body>`. (Certain start tags and end tags can in certain cases be omitted and are implied by other tags.).
And certain elements don't have any end tag.

A **start tag** is denoted by `<` followed by the `name` of the element, and then followed by `>`. <br />
A **end tag** is denoted by `</` followed by the `name` of the element, and then followed by `>`.

Examples

```html
<html>
  ..
</html>
<p>...</p>
<br />
<div>...</div>
```

### Attributes

Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements work. In the example below, there is a hyperlink, formed using the `a` element and its `href` attribute.

Attributes are placed inside the start tag, and consist of a `name` and a `value`, separated by an "`=`" character.

The attribute value can remain unquoted if it doesn't contain ASCII whitespace or any of " ' ` = < or >. Otherwise, it has to be quoted using either single or double quotes. The value, along with the "=" character, can be omitted altogether if the value is the empty string.

```html
<!-- empty attributes -->
<input name="address" disabled />
<input name="address" disabled="" />

<!-- attributes with a value -->
<input name="address" maxlength="200" />
<input name="address" maxlength="200" />
<input name="address" maxlength="200" />
```

### DOM

HTML user agents (e.g. Web browsers) then parse this markup, turning it into a DOM (Document Object Model) tree. A DOM tree is an in-memory representation of a document.

DOM trees contain several kinds of nodes, in particular a `DocumentType` node, `Element` nodes, `Text` nodes, `Comment` nodes, and in some cases `ProcessingInstruction` nodes.

The markup [snippet](/#structureofhtml5) at the top of this section would be turned into the following DOM tree

```
|-- DOCTYPE: html   // DocumentType node
|-- html lang="en"  // Element node
  |-- head
    |--#text: ⏎␣␣   // Text node
    |--title
    |--|--#text: Sample page
    |--#text: ⏎␣
  |--#text: ⏎␣
  |--body
     |--#text: ⏎␣␣
     |--h1
     |--|--#text: Sample page
     |--#text: ⏎␣␣
     |--p
     |--|--#text: This is a
     |--|--a href="demo.html"
     |--|--|--#text: simple
     |--|--#text: sample.
     |--#text: ⏎␣␣
     |--#comment: this is a comment  // Comment node
     |--#text: ⏎␣⏎
```

### Styling

To influence exactly how such rendering takes place, authors can use a styling language such as CSS.

In the following example, the page has been made yellow-on-blue using CSS.

```html
<style>
  body {
    background: navy;
    color: yellow;
  }
</style>
```

Result:

<div style="height:200px;background: navy;color: yellow;">
  This is a yellow text with navy color background on the whole body.
</div>

### Scripting

The above DOM tree can be manipulated from scripts in the page.
Scripts (typically in JavaScript) are small programs
that can be embedded using the [`script`]() element or using [`event handler content`]() attributes.

Each element in the DOM tree is represented by an object, and these objects have APIs so that they can be manipulated.

For example,

```html
<!-- onsubmit attribute is the event handler content attribute -->
<form name="main" onsubmit="return false;">
  Output: <output name="result"></output>
  <!-- script element -->
  <script>
    document.forms.main.elements.result.value = "Hello World";
  </script>
</form>
```
