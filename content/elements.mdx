### Semantics

Elements, attributes, and attribute values in HTML have certain meanings (semantics).
For example, the `ol` element represents an ordered list, and the `lang` attribute represents the language of the content.

These definitions allow HTML processors, such as Web browsers or search engines, to present and use documents and applications in a wide variety of contexts that the author might not have considered.

The webpages we write can be used by the web browsers on desktop, small browsers on mobile,
used by a blind user using a browser based around speech synthesis, software can make use of this information. Search engines can use the headings to more effectively index a page, or to provide quick links to subsections of the page from their results.

So authors must not use elements, attributes, or attribute values for purposes other than their appropriate intended semantic purpose, as doing so prevents software from correctly processing the page.

### Elements in the DOM

Elements in the DOM represent things; that is, they have intrinsic meaning, also known as semantics.

The basic interface, from which all the HTML elements' interfaces inherit, is the `HTMLElement` interface.
